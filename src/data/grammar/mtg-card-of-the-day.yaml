cotdTitle:
  - CARD OF THE DAY
cotdDescription:
  - "If you're looking to beef up #character#'s tribal support next [_date:business day,weekend,week,month,week,month,year,year,decade,century]#_date#, make sure to look at the #creatureTypes.capitalize# tribal pushes we made back in #randomCardSet.capitalize# and #randomCardSet.capitalize#."
  - "If you're looking to beef up #character#'s tribal support next [_date:business day,weekend,week,month,week,month,year,year,decade,century]#_date#, make sure to look at the #creatureTypes.capitalize# tribal pushes we made back in #randomCardSet.capitalize# and #randomCardSet.capitalize#."
  - "This blast from the [_time:future,past,future,past,present,distant future,distant past]#_time# is back, and it's still the only way for a player to #marginalThingToDo#! Although with #keyword# coming back, I don't think any keyword is off the menu moving forward."
  - "When your opponent plays #kindaGood.a# spell, your first #cardWhichDrawsCards# is probably to try to cause them to have #cardWhichCountersSpells.a#."
  - "This versatile #cardCategory# has already shown itself as an all-star of the new metagame. Check out the Pro Tour this weekend to see if the #deckArchOrCategory# dominance continues!"
  - "This card seems #kindaGood#...until you realize that it means there's a legendary #creatureTypes.capitalize# token to be had. Then it becomes #reallyGood#."
  - "It's no surprise that #basicColors.capitalize#'s most versatile removal spell finds its way into almost every #deckArchOrCategory# deck that can host it. Plus it offers some of the most hilarious flavor plays the game has ever seen."
  - "Long ago, some #creatureTypes# decided to stick #massNoun#-infused #bodypart# armor onto what appears to be a pair of #itemNoun.s#. Today, almost every #characterClass# has donned a pair to dodge removal as they dash into battle."
  - "Every player aspires to have as many #_cardname.s# as they have #colors# #deckArchOrCategory# decks."
  - "#multicolor# #deckLimitedArchetype.capitalize# may be the favored deck for this color combo, but that doesn't mean #multicolor# #keyword# isn't always happy to have another tool in its back pocket!"

cotdCardTypeDescriptionGood:
 - "Only on #plane# would people see this #adjImpressive# #_creatureType# and nickname it [_nickname:The #adj.capitalizeAll.hyphenate# #characterClass.capitalizeAll#,#planeswalkerFirstName#'s #characterClass.capitalizeAll#]“#_nickname#”."
 - "Now that we know that this #_creatureType# is the [_source:creator,progenitor,source]#_source# of all #_creatureType#kind across the multiverse (even #tribalCreature#), does that mean that every #_creatureType# is a Scion of the #_cardname#?"
 - "#_creatureType.capitalize.s# may not ascend to #characterClass.hyphenate#hood very often, but when they do, the results tend to be #adj#."
 - "If you're looking for an impressive bomb in #teaserCardSet# limited, look no further than this #adj# #_creatureType#."
 - "Things took a dark turn [_where:at the #storyLocation# #placeNoun#,in #minorStoryLocation#,in #nonPlaneLocation#]#_where# after this #_creatureType# learned they had run out of [_item:#itemNoun.s#,#massNoun#]#_item#."
 - "#_creatureType.capitalize# tribal, meet #format#. We've wanted to introduce you two for a while, and we thought [_adj:loving,friendly,abundant,populated,inhabited][_where:the #_creatureType#-#_adj# plane of #plane#,#teaserCardSet#]#_where# would be the perfect place for you to meet."

cotdCardTypeNeedsWork:
  - "Finally, #_creatureType# tribal has the [_key:lord,crucial piece]#_key# it needs to be [_adj:viable,constructed playable,competetive]#_adj#."
