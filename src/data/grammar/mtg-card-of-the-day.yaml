cotdTitle:
  - CARD OF THE DAY
cotdDescription:
  - "If you're looking to beef up #character#'s tribal support next [_date:business day,weekend,week,month,week,month,year,year,decade,century]#_date#, make sure to look at the #creatureTypes.capitalize# tribal pushes we made back in #randomCardSet.capitalize# and #randomCardSet.capitalize#."
  - "This blast from the [_time:future,past,future,past,present,distant future,distant past]#_time# is back, and it's still the only way for a player to #marginalThingToDo#! Although with #keyword# coming back, I don't think any keyword is off the menu moving forward."
  - "When your opponent plays #kindaGood.a# spell, your first #cardWhichDrawsCards# is probably to try to cause them to have #cardWhichCountersSpells.a#."
  - "This versatile #cardCategory# has already shown itself as an all-star of the new metagame. Check out the Pro Tour this weekend to see if the #deckArchOrCategory# dominance continues!"
  - "This card seems #kindaGood#...until you realize that it means there's a legendary #creatureTypes.capitalize# token to be had. Then it becomes #reallyGood#."
  - "It's no surprise that #basicColors.capitalize#'s most versatile removal spell finds its way into almost every #deckArchOrCategory# deck that can host it. Plus it offers some of the most hilarious flavor plays the game has ever seen."
  - "Long ago, some #creatureTypes# decided to stick #massNoun#-infused #bodypart# armor onto what appears to be a pair of #itemNoun.s#. Today, almost every #characterClass# has donned a pair to dodge removal as they dash into battle."
  - "Every player aspires to have as many #_cardname.s# as they have #colors# #deckArchOrCategory# decks."
  - "#multicolor# #deckLimitedArchetype.capitalize# may be the favored deck for this color combo, but that doesn't mean #multicolor# #keyword# isn't always happy to have another tool in its back pocket!"
