# bug / fix: [_searchTerm:creatures you control][_searchTermReplacement:#cardCategoryOrCreatureType#s you control, creatures <your opponent controls | etc.>]#card# now correctly reads #_searchTerm# instead of #__searchTermReplacement#.

# Split cards such as Cut // Ribbons are reported as 3 cards in the chat log.
# -> [searchableCardClass such as _cardname are| are no longer #cardfate#]
