# bug fix: #card# no longer displays the rules text for nonlandCard | [it now displays the rules text for nonlandCard2 | although it still works as if it does | because it no longer displays any rules text (at all)]

# bug / fix: [_searchTerm:creatures you control][_searchTermReplacement:#cardCategoryOrCreatureType#s you control, creatures <your opponent controls | etc.>]#card# now correctly reads #_searchTerm# instead of #__searchTermReplacement#.

# Split cards such as Cut // Ribbons are reported as 3 cards in the chat log.
# -> [searchableCardClass such as _cardname are| are no longer #cardfate#]
# -> []

# card costs {random mana or other cost} instead of its expected mana cost

# incorrectly prevents ...
# wrong frame (frame color) / border
# a workaround is [zooming in on the token]
# causes players to GAIN/LOSE (N?) life instead of LOSING/GAINING life. search for "lose $! life" or "loses $! life" (same for gain)
