All in Good Time
All Shall Smolder in My Wake
Approach My Molten Realm
Behold the Power of Destruction
Choose Your Champion
Dance, Pathetic Marionette
The Dead Shall Serve
A Display of My Dark Power
Embrace My Diabolical Vision
Every Hope Shall Vanish
Every Last Vestige Shall Rot
Evil Comes to Fruition
The Fate of the Flammable
Feed the Machine
I Bask in Your Silent Awe
I Call on the Ancient Magics
I Delight in Your Convulsions
I Know All, I See All
Ignite the Cloneforge!
Into the Earthen Maw
Introductions Are in Order
The Iron Guardian Stirs
Know Naught but Fire
Look Skyward and Despair
May Civilization Collapse
Mortal Flesh Is Weak
My Crushing Masterstroke
My Genius Knows No Bounds
My Undead Horde Awakens
My Wish Is Your Command
Nature Demands an Offering
Nature Shields Its Own
Nothing Can Stop Me Now
Only Blood Ends Your Nightmares
The Pieces Are Coming Together
Realms Befitting My Majesty
Roots of All Evil
Rotted Ones, Lay Siege
Surrender Your Thoughts
Tooth, Claw, and Tail
The Very Soil Shall Shake
Which of You Burns Brightest?
Your Fate Is Thrice Sealed
Your Puny Minds Cannot Fathom
Your Will Is Not Your Own
Plots That Span Centuries
Perhaps You've Met My Cohort
Your Inescapable Doom
Drench The Soil In Their Blood
Imprison This Insolent Wretch
